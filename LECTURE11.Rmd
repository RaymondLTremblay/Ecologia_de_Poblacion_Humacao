**Q**: Is the intrinsic rate of growth $r_{max}$ positive or negative for most species on earth? Why???

**Q**: Given that most species are capable of sustained growth and attaining large population size under favorable conditions, how do populations get small in the first place? Why are some populations declining despite their intrinsic ability to grow?

## Threats to populations

The answer of course is that the intrinsic ability to grow under ideal conditions is not the whole story. Populations are stocks with inflows and outflows- and if mortalities exceed births *under present conditions* the population will decline until these unfavorable conditions are reversed. 

In the "small-population paradigm" lecture we discussed several **stochastic threats** to populations, including loss of genetic diversity (genetic drift), demographic stochasticity, catastrophic environmental events. These threats only really affect small populations. Large populations are mostly resilient to stochastic threats.

Large populations can be threatened though! Factors that threaten large populations with large geographic ranges are generally **deterministic**! 

The **declining population paradigm** focuses on the factors that make large populations small -- that is, it is the *study of those deterministic processes that cause population decline, and how these processes may be reversed through effective conservation management*. 

What are some factors that can *tip the balance* so to speak- so that growing or stable populations become declining populations?

## The controversy in Conservation Biology!

So, which one is more important for conservation? The declining-population paradigm or the small-population paradigm??

This "controversy" was ignited by a [very influential paper by Graeme Caughley](caughley1.pdf) in *Journal of Animal Ecology* in 1994.

![](caughley1.jpg)

In this paper, Caughley defines the two competing paradigms, and expresses a bias towards one paradigm and against the other...

> Conservation biology has two threads: the small-population paradigm which deals with the effect of smallness on the persistence of a population, and the declining- population paradigm which deals with the cause of smallness and its cure.

**Q**: Can you detect Caughley's bias in the above quote? 

**Q**: What do you think? Do you agree with Caughley?

### In-Class Exercise: Deterministic threats

Let's try a worked example to illustrate the above points.

Let's start with a basic scalar, density-dependent population -- should look something like this:

You can clone this model by clicking [here](https://insightmaker.com/insight/74417/ICE-declining-population-paradigm)

You should see logistic growth (with demographic stochasticity) if you hit the simulate button. Take a minute to run the model and make sure you understand how it works.

For this exercise, let's change the initial population to 200 (half of K).

Also, make sure that the time step is 1 year, and the model should run for 50 years.

**Let's add a harvest process!**

- Assume that approximately 10% of the population is harvested each year. However, the true harvest rate is stochastic- occasionally harvest goes as high as 15%, and occasionally as low as 5%. (here we are introducing stochasticity in a "deterministic" threat- don't think about that too hard!)  

**Q**: what random number generator did you choose for simulating harvest rate?

**Q**: is the variation in harvest rates best considered a type of *demographic stochasticity*, or a type of *environmental stochasticity*?    

**Q**: why doesn't the population decline to extinction? What has the harvest process done in this case?   

**Q**: What if you change the harvest rate- make it even more extreme?

**Let's add a habitat loss process!**

- Assume that habitat loss results in larger density-dependence terms on survival and fecundity- that is, because there is less habitat, the effects of crowding are more pronounced (NOTE: this is already implemented for you! Do you understand why this works?).   

- Let's first model the case where 10% of K is lost each year. 

- Run the simulation to visually track K along with population dynamics! 

**Q**: Does the loss of K look right? Is this what you expected?

**Q**: Does the reduction in K over time look realistic? Can you imagine other plausible shapes for this curve?

- Try running the model with only habitat loss (no harvest - set harvest to zero). 

**Q**: Does anything look different? Are the results different from what you expected?  

- Try changing the harvest process to be 10 individuals per year instead of 10% of the population per year. 

**Q**: How does this change the results?    

**Q**: What would happen if the habitat loss process were better represented by a *linear* versus *exponential* decline in K?? Try it!    

**Q**: Try different combinations of deterministic threats (competing threats!). Can you identify some combinations that are *synergistic*- that is, that affect population decline or extinction risk more than simply adding the effects of each threat in isolation??  

**Q**: Can you identify some combinations of threats that are *"antergistic"* (not a real word!)- that is, that affect population decline or extinction risk less than simply adding the effects of each threat in isolation??

**Q**: Does stochasticity in harvest rates matter more than stochasticity in habitat loss? Or vice versa?
