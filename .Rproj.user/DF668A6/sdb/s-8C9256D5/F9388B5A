We will emphasize practical approaches to problem-solving in ecology, conservation, and wildlife management via creative application of population ecology theory using simulation models and statistics. Topics will include population viability analysis (PVA), site-occupancy models, habitat suitability models, metapopulation models, species co-occurrence models, projecting biodiversity response to climate change and more. Laboratory exercises will provide students with hands-on experience with ecological models and their practical applications.\n\n### Learning outcomes\n1.\tIdentify the major classes of models used by ecologists (e.g., statistical vs mechanistic, quantitative vs heuristic, stochastic vs deterministic) and explain how and why ecologists use these models.   \n2.\tApply tools such as population viability analysis (PVA), site-occupancy models, and metapopulation models to address the conservation and management of natural populations.  \n3.\tPerform basic statistics, data visualization, simulation modeling and model validation with Excel and the statistical computing language “R”.  \n4.\tCritically evaluate the strength of inferences drawn from ecological simulation models using tools such as cross-validation and sensitivity analysis.  \n5.\tExplain how species interactions can influence predictions of species range shifts and the biodiversity response to global change, and formulate strategies for accounting for species interactions in ecological models.    \n6.\tCommunicate original research in applied population and community ecology via a professional oral presentation.   \n\n### Grading: \nThe course grade will be based on the following components:\n\nLab projects (8 projects total)\t 25% (80 pts)    \nFinal group project              25% (80 pts)    \nMidterm exam # 1 (date TBD)\t     12.5% (40 pts)    \nMidterm exam # 2 (date TBD)   \t 12.5% (40 pts)    \nFinal exam (date TBD)   \t       25% (80 pts)    \n(Total\t320 points)    \n\nNOTE: Graduate students enrolled in 670 will have an additional 50 pts used to calculate their grade (see below) of a total of 370 points. \nGrading scale: A (100 to 93), A- (92 to 90), B+ (89 to 87), B (86 to 83), B- (82 to 80), C+ (79 to 77), C (76 to 73), C- (72 to 70), D+ (69 to 67), D (66 to 63), D- (62 to 60), F (below 60). \n\n### Exams:\nThere will be two midterm exams and a comprehensive final exam. These will consist of multiple-choice, short-answer questions, and essay questions requiring synthesis of ideas and critical thinking. The midterm exam will be cumulative, and based on all information presented up through the week prior to the exam.\n\n### Lectures\nLecture grades will be based primarily on participation and occasional short quizzes. Participation is essential to the learning process, and to our mutual enjoyment of this class. Learning is not a passive process; students are expected to engage with the material in class rather than simply listen and take notes. You should be prepared in class to ask questions, to answer questions posed by other students, and to engage in occasional group problem-solving activities (in class). \n\n### Labs  \nLab exercises will focus on applying concepts and methods introduced in lectures, and will involve real data and problems in wildlife conservation and management wherever possible. Graded lab assignments will involve figures, tables, InsightMaker models and R code (when applicable) and responses to questions in short-answer format. Laboratory write-ups will be due the following lab period, unless otherwise specified. \n\n### Field Trips\nWe will be taking 1-2 field trips to collect wildlife population data. One field trip will be full-day, on a weekend: bring breakfast, lunch, and plenty of water. Bring any appropriate gear for spending the day in the field including: binoculars, spotting scopes, and field guides, and wear appropriate clothing for hiking. Be prepared for inclement weather.\n\n### Group project \nStudents will work in groups of ~3-4 people and together address a problem in applied population ecology using real-world data (e.g., collected by a UNR ecology lab). Grading will be based on finished products (written and oral presentations) as well as participation and peer evaluations. \n\n### Graduate credit (for those enrolled in NRES670) \nGraduate students will be subject to additional expectations in order to receive graduate credit for this course. In particular, graduate student final group projects are expected to be more in-depth than undergraduate group projects. To this end, graduate student presentations will be longer, and project write-ups will be expected to be of publication-quality (and formatted in the style of an appropriate journal). Graduate students will also be expected to achieve a deeper understanding of the course material, and therefore will be assigned additional readings from the scientific literature.\n\n### Make-up policy and late work:\nMissed exams and labs cannot be made up, except in the case of emergencies. If you miss a class meeting, it is your responsibility to talk to one of your classmates about what you missed. If you miss a lab meeting, you are still responsible for completing the lab activities and write-up on your own time. You do not need to let me know in advance that you are going to miss class or lab.\n\n### Students with Disabilities\nAny student with a disability needing academic adjustments or accommodations is requested to speak with the Disability Resource Center (Thompson Building, Suite 101) as soon as possible to arrange for appropriate accommodations.\n\n### Statement on Academic Dishonesty\nCheating, plagiarism or otherwise obtaining grades under false pretenses constitute academic dishonesty according to the code of this university. Plagiarism is using the ideas or words of another person without giving credit to the original source; this includes copying another student in class. Always cite the source of your information. This includes copying or paraphrasing from a book, journal, or unpublished material without giving credit to the author(s), and submitting a term paper that was used in another course. Students who plagiarize will receive a final course grade of F and will be subject to University level disciplinary action.\n\n### Statement on Audio and Video Recording\nSurreptitious or covert video-taping of class or unauthorized audio recording of class is prohibited by law and by Board of Regents policy. This class may be videotaped or audio recorded only with the written permission of the instructor. In order to accommodate students with disabilities, some students may have been given permission to record class lectures and discussions. Therefore, students should understand that their comments during class may be recorded.\n\n### Statement for Academic Success Services\nYour student fees cover usage of the University Math Center [(775) 784-4433], University Tutoring Center [(775) 784-6801], and [University Writing Center (775) 784-6030]. These centers support your classroom learning; it is your responsibility to take advantage of their services.\n\n### Class protocol\nAll electronic devices are to be turned off during class unless the instructor gives advance permission.\n\n\n```{r echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}\nrmarkdown::render('index.Rmd', 'word_document')\n\n```\n\n",
