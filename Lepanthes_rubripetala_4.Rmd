# Lepanthes rubripetala population #3

### How to construct a matrix in R

```{r}
 R3=matrix(c(
0.43, 	0,	    0,	 0.14,
0.38,	0.84, 	0,	0, 
0, 	    0,	    0.51,	0.15,	
0,      0.14,    0.43, 0.84
), byrow=TRUE, ncol=4)

Lrub1=R3

Lrub1
```


## Two problems need to be evaluated before analysis 

 - **Ergodicity** (the condition that regardless of the initial stage
structure, the asymptotic growth rate will be the same) 

 - **Irreducibility**
(the condition that the transitions from all stages to all other
stages are possible), 

failure to meet both of these conditions which may severely impact matrix structure
and analyses (Stott et al., 2010a).


You can test this with the following functions from "popdemo". 

```{r}
isErgodic(Lrub1, digits=10, return.eigvec=FALSE)
isIrreducible(Lrub1)

```
 
 lambda(Lrub1)

 Here is the theoretical life cycle of the species
 
![Theoretical life cycle](figures/Fig_theoretical_Life_cycle.png)

## Reality of the data collection

However the data from this matrix is limited because seeds and fungy infection cannot be evaluated in the field, because seeds are too small and there is no quick technique in the field to detedct the symbiotic fungi.  

This matrix is size-based, with medium fecundity.
 The size classes are as follows:
 - 1: Plantula
 - 2: Juveniles
 - 3: A0: non-reproductive adults
 - 4: A+: reproductive adults

#FIGURE 1: POPULATION PROJECTION
#


#This figure is designed to be 3.5" by 3.5"
#(Check size of plot window using 'par(din)').
#
#
#Set margins:
par(mar=c(5,4,1,1))

#Create a population vector. 
This one is biased towards adults.

```{r}
n0 <- c(0, 0, 2, 0)

```


## Now project the population for x years in the future.  


Project the orchid PPM and population vector.  In this case, we are projecting for 24 time intervals.  The orchid interval is one month, so this projection is for 2 years.  We use the function 'project'.


```{r}
pr1 <- project(Lrub1, vector=n0, time=24)

#Plot the projection. This uses an S3 plotting
#method for projections. For info, see '?plot.projection'.  
plot(pr1)

```


## Primitive Matrix
For a primitive matrix (see below), the long-term growth rate is the real  part of the first dominant eigenvalue of the PPM.

```{r}
eigs <- eigen(Lrub1)
eigs
lambdamax <- Re(eigs$values[1])
lambdamax
```

Stable Stable Stage distribution 


The stable demographic structure of the population is equal to the dominant right eigenvector, which is the absolute value of the real part of the first eigenvector.

This is the expected proportional distribution among the different stages **IF** the population attains a sable structure.   

```{r}

w <- stable.stage(Lrub1)
w
```

Note that the package popbio provides functions 'lambda' and 'stable.stage' that will provide these also.


For more info on projecting population dynamics, see demo(projection).

## TRANSIENT DYNAMICS

__________________________________________________________________________
#
Fig. 2a: Population-specific transient dynamics
#
This figure is designed to be 3.5" by 3.5"
(Check size of plot window using 'par(din)').

Set margins:
par(mar=c(10,4,1,1))

Create 2 population vectors.  One is adult-
biased, and it amplifies.  One is juvenile-
biased and it attenuates.

n0.amp <- c(1000,1,1,1)

n0.att <- c(1,1,1,1000)

Project these vectors using the project function.
We are standardising the matrix using 'standard.A=T'
to remove effects of asymptotic dynamics. This 
means that the projection has a long-term growth
rate of unity, i.e. it does not grow or decline in 
the long-term.  We also standardise the population
vector to sum to 1 using 'standard.vec=T'.
These standardisations make it easier (and fairer)
to compare between models with different population 
sizes, and different long-term growth rates.
pr2.1 <- project(Lrub1, vector=n0.amp, time=156, 
                 standard.A=T, standard.vec=T)
pr2.2 <- project(Lrub1, vector=n0.att, time=156, 
                 standard.A=T, standard.vec=T)

Plot the amplification projection and label it
plot(pr2.1, ylim=c(0.4,1), log="y", cex.axis=0.8)
text(52, pr2.1[51], "amplification", 
     adj=c(1,-0.5), cex=0.8)
maxamp(Lrub1, vector=n0.amp)
reactivity(Lrub1,vector=n0.amp)
inertia(Lrub1,vector=n0.amp)

Calculate the transient dynamics of the
amplification projection
reac <- reactivity(Lrub1, vector=n0.amp)
maxamp <- maxamp(Lrub1, vector=n0.amp, return.t=T)
upinertia <- inertia(Lrub1, vector=n0.amp)

Add points on the projection for amplification
and label them
points(c(1,maxamp$t,31), c(reac,maxamp$maxamp,upinertia), 
       pch=3, col="red")
text(1, reac, expression(bar(P)[1]), 
     adj=c(-0.3,0.5), col="red", cex=0.8)
text(maxamp$t, maxamp$maxamp, expression(bar(P)[max]), 
     adj=c(0.1,-0.5), col="red", cex=0.8)
text(31, upinertia, expression(bar(P)[infinity]), 
     adj=c(0.1,-0.5), col="red", cex=0.8)

Add in the second projection using the
'lines' command and label it
lines(0:50, pr2.2)
text(52, pr2.2[51], "attenuation", adj=c(1,1), cex=0.8)

Calculate the transient dynamics of the 
attenuation projection
firstep <- firststepatt(Lrub1, vector=n0.att)
maxatt <- maxatt(Lrub1, vector=n0.att, return.t=T)
lowinertia <- inertia(Lrub1, vector=n0.att)

firststepatt(Lrub1, vector=n0.att)
maxatt(Lrub1, vector=n0.att, return.t=T)
inertia(Lrub1, vector=n0.att)

Add points on the attenuation projection
and label them
points(c(1,maxatt$t,31), c(firstep,maxatt$maxatt,lowinertia), 
       pch=3, col="red")
text(1, firstep, expression(underline(P)[1]), 
     adj=c(0,-0.6), col="red", cex=0.8)
text(maxatt$t, maxatt$maxatt, expression(underline(P)[min]), 
     adj=c(0.1,1.5), col="red", cex=0.8)
text(31, lowinertia, expression(underline(P)[infinity]), 
     adj=c(0.1,1.5), col="red", cex=0.8)

Add in a dotted line at y=1
lines(c(0,50),c(1,1),lty=2)

__________________________________________________________________________

Fig. 2b: Transient bounds
This figure is designed to be 3.5" by 3.5"
(Check size of plot window using 'par(din)').

Set margins:
par(mar=c(5,4,1,1))

Transient bounds result from projections of
the stage-biased dynamics of the model.
When using the function 'project', the
stage-biased model dynamics are projected 
automatically if no population vector is specified.
We can do this for the orchid, using a 
standardised matrix like before:
pr2 <- project(Lrub1, standard.A=TRUE, time=156)

Now we need to plot these population dynamics.
The S3 method for projections automatically plots
all stage-biased projections:
plot(pr2, log="y", cex.axis=0.8, ylim=c(0.4,1.5))

Add in a dotted line at y=1
lines(c(0,156), c(1,1), lty=2)

Calculate the bounds on transient dynamics for
the orchid.  This is also done automatically if
no population vector is specified.
reacb <- reactivity(Lrub1)
firstepb <- firststepatt(Lrub1)
maxampb <- maxamp(Lrub1, return.t=T)
maxattb <- maxatt(Lrub1, return.t=T)
upinertiab <- inertia(Lrub1, bound="upper")
lowinertiab <- inertia(Lrub1, bound="lower")


reactivity(Lrub1)
firststepatt(Lrub1)
maxamp(Lrub1, return.t=T)
maxatt(Lrub1, return.t=T)
inertia(Lrub1, bound="upper")
inertia(Lrub1, bound="lower")



Add points on the projection and label them
points(c(1,1,maxampb$t,maxattb$t,31,31),
       c(reacb,firstepb,maxampb$maxamp,maxattb$maxatt,upinertiab,lowinertiab),
       pch=3,col="red")
text(1, reacb, expression(bar(rho)[1]), 
     adj=c(-0.5,0.5), col="red", cex=0.8)
text(1, firstepb, expression(underline(rho)[1]),
     adj=c(-0.5,1.5), col="red", cex=0.8)
text(maxampb$t, maxampb$maxamp, expression(bar(rho)[max]),
     adj=c(0.1,-0.5), col="red", cex=0.8)
text(maxattb$t, maxattb$maxatt, expression(underline(rho)[min]),
     adj=c(0.1,1.5), col="red", cex=0.8)
text(31, upinertiab, expression(bar(rho)[infinity]), 
     adj=c(0.1,-0.5), col="red", cex=0.8)
text(31, lowinertiab, expression(underline(rho)[infinity]),
     adj=c(0.1,1.5), col="red", cex=0.8)

Amplification bounds result from the projection of a
population with 100% stage x individuals.  Attenuation
bounds result from the projection of a population with
100% stage 1 individuals.

FIGURE 3: TRANSFER FUNCTIONS

__________________________________________________________________________

Fig. 3a: Transfer function of asymptotic growth

This figure is designed to be 3.5" by 3.5"
(Check size of plot window using 'par(din)').

Set margins:
par(mar=c(5,4,1,1))

Create a transfer function using 'tfa'.
The perturbation structure is determined by
two vectors d and e.  The matrix d%*%t(e) gives the 
structure, where nonzero elements in this matrix
are the elements of the PPM to be perturbed.  The
relative size of entries in this matrix are the relative
sizes of perturbation to those elements.
In this case, we are perturbing element [5,4].
We are going to look at the effect of perturbing
up to 0.25.  The largest biologically reasonable 
perturbation is about 0.12.
tf1 <- tfa(Lrub1, d=c(1,0,0,0), e=c(0,0,1,0), 
         prange=seq(0,0.25,0.01))

Now we plot this using an S3 method for transfer functions
(for information see '?plot.tfa').
plot(tf1, cex.axis=0.8)

Now we're going to add in the sensitivity tangent.  This has
an intercept of lambda-max, and a slope of the sensitivity
of the same transfer function.
Calculate lambda-max of the desert tortoise PPM:
lambda <- Re(eigen(LaeliaZ1)$values[1])

Calculate the sensitivity using the function 'tfsens':
sens1 <- tfsens(Lrub1, d=c(0,0,0,1), e=c(0,0,1,0))

Now add in the line, specifying the correct intercept and slope:
abline(lambda, sens1, lty=2, col="red")

__________________________________________________________________________

Fig. 3b: Transfer function of population inertia

This figure is designed to be 3.5" by 3.5"
(Check size of plot window using 'par(din)').

Set margins:
par(mar=c(5,4,1,1))

The process is very similar to above.  We need to specify
a PPM, perturbation structure and perturbation range.  For
inertia we either have to specify a population vector using
the 'vector' argument, or the bound to be calculated using the
'bound' argument.
Create a population vector:
n0 <- c(1,8,13,21)

tf1 <- tfa(Lrub1, d=c(0,0,0,1), e=c(0,0,1,0), 
         prange=seq(0,0.25,0.01))

Now calculate the transfer function using inertia.tfa:
tf2 <- inertia.tfa(Lrub1, vector=n0, d=c(0,0,0,1), 
                 e=c(0,0,1,0), prange= seq(0,0.25,0.01))

Plot the transfer function using the same S3 method as before:
plot(tf2, cex.axis=0.8, ylim=c(3.9,4.43))

The sensitivity tangent for transfer function of inertia has
an intercept of equal to the relevant inertia (either using 
the same population vector, or the correct bound), and a slope 
of the sensitivity of the same transfer function.
Calculate inertia of the desert tortoise PPM using the
population vector:
inertia <- inertia(Lrub1, vector=n0)

Calculate the sensitivity using the function 'inertia.tfsens':
sens2 <- inertia.tfsens(Lrub1, vector=n0, d=c(0,0,0,1), 
                        e=c(0,0,1,0), tolerance=1e-5)

(Here the 'tolerance' has had to be lowered to avoid calculation error:
try the function without that argument and it will have trouble running)

Now add in the line, specifying the correct intercept and slope:
abline(inertia, sens2, lty=2, col="red")

FIGURE 4: TRANSFER FUNCTION MATRIX

This figure is designed to be 7" by 7"
(Check size of plot window using 'par(din)').

This is a nice, easy plot because the function does it all for you.
The functions 'tfmat' and 'inertia.tfmat' calculate a transfer function
for every PPM element.  They are saved as arrays of values.  The functions
are customisable: see '?tfmat' and '?inertia.tfmat'.

Create the array for inertia, using a specific population vector:
n0 <- c(48, 16, 12, 10)
tfmat <- inertia.tfamatrix(Lrub1, vector=n0)

...and plot it!
plot(tfmat)

n0 <- c(48, 16, 12, 10)
tfmat <- tfamatrix(Lrub1)

...and plot it!
plot(tfmat)
