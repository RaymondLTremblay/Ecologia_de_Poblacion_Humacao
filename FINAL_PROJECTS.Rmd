## Final projects for NRES 470

Students will work in groups of ~2-3 people to perform a population viability analysis (PVA) to rank conservation or management actions for a species of conservation concern (species of your choice!). Grading will be based on finished products (written and oral presentations) as well as participation and peer evaluations.

## Overview

- Select a species and management question of interest. 

- Perform a thorough literature review on your species of interest- collect all information you can about life history, key vital rates and their variability. 

- Construct a PVA model, parameterized using the best available information from the literature (free PVA software platforms: InsightMaker, Vortex, R). 

- Use your PVA model to address a conservation or management question and write up the results. 

- Present your results to the class!

## Timeline

- **PROPOSAL:** Due March 3!
- **INITIAL PVA** Due March 31: description of how your PVA model works and where the parameter estimates come from.
- **DRAFT FINAL PAPER:** Due April 14
- **FINAL FINAL PAPER:** Due May 5
- **FINAL PRESENTATIONS:** May 5 in lab

Remember that the semester will get crazy at the end (including for your instructors). Plan ahead! 

## First project-related assignment: the proposal!

(Due March 3...) 

Your project proposal will consist of:  

1. **Title**: should indicate what species you are modeling, and what question will be addressed   
2. **Project participants**: work in groups of 2-3. Obviously we won't have very many groups this year!    
3. **Project rationale**: Describe the rationale for choosing this species and management/conservation question. Be as specific as possible! Convince your instructors that your project is **interesting**!    
4. **Data sources**: Describe what data/information sources you plan to use to guide PVA construction and parameterization. Convince your instructors that your project is **possible**!  

**NOTE about data sources:** The most important parameters you need for a PVA model are *survival rates* (usually age-structured), *fecundity rates* (often age-structured as well), *stochasticity* (variability in those vital rates), *abundance*, *dispersal rates*, and *carrying capacity*. We have gone over all these concepts in class already- PVA is just a way of putting all these concepts together in a single model! You can either get these parameter estimates directly from the published literature (or unpublished reports), or you estimate these parameters yourself using raw data (which we haven't yet gone over in class). If all else fails, you can use published records for similar species!

## Second project-related assignment: the initial PVA!

(Due March 3...) 

Your inital parameterized PVA will consist of:  

1. A ready-to-run PVA model, in whatever software framework you are using (Vortex, InsightMaker, R). This model does not need to be the "final" model, but it should work (e.g., produce results) and the parameter estimates should be reasonable and backed by evidence (see below).

2. A description of parameter estimates and rationale/evidence for these estimates. 
    a. For each major decision you made in constructing the model, describe the information you used to back up your decision (and the source of this information). Decisions include: how many populations, how many stages, how density-dependence operates for your species, allee effects, survival and fecundity rates, environmental stochasticity, catastrophes, etc. Where appropriate, feel free to embed figures, maps, etc. from your information sources.
    b. Literature cited (format not important, as long as it includes all key information).
