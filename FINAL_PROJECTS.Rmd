## Final projects for NRES 470

Students will work in groups of ~2-3 people to perform a population viability analysis (PVA) to rank conservation or management actions for a species of conservation concern (species of your choice!). Grading will be based on finished products (written and oral presentations) as well as participation and peer evaluations.

## Overview

- Select a species and management question of interest. 

- Perform a thorough literature review on your species of interest- collect all information you can about life history, key vital rates and their variability. 

- Construct a PVA model, parameterized using the best available information from the literature (free PVA software platforms: InsightMaker, Vortex, R). 

- Use your PVA model to address a conservation or management question and write up the results. 

- Present your results to the class!

## Timeline

- **PROPOSAL:** Due March 3!
- **PVA FULLY PARAMETERIZED** Due March 24: description of how your PVA model works and where the parameter estimates come from.
- **DRAFT FINAL PAPER:** Due April 14
- **FINAL FINAL PAPER:** Due May 5
- **FINAL PRESENTATIONS:** May 5 in lab

Remember that the semester will get crazy at the end. Plan ahead! 

## First project-related assignment: the proposal!

(Due March 3...) 

Your project proposal will consist of:  

1. Title: should indicate what species you are modeling, and what question will be addressed   
2. Project participants: work in groups of 2-3. Obviously we won't have very many groups this year!    
3. Project rationale: Describe the rationale for choosing this species and management/conservation question. Be as specific as possible! Convince your instructors that your project is **interesting**!    
4. Data sources: Describe what data sources you plan to use to guide PVA construction and parameterization. Convince your instructors that your project is **possible**!
