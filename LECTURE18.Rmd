    - Density-dependent pop growth (Gotelli Ch. 2, [lecture](LECTURE3.html), [lecture](LECTURE4.html), [lecture](LECTURE5.html), [lab](LAB2.html))
    - Age-structured pop growth and matrix population models (Gotelli Ch. 3; [lecture](LECTURE6.html), [lecture](LECTURE7.html), [lab](LAB3.html), [lab](LAB4.html) additional suggested reading: [Heppell et al. 1998](heppell1.pdf))

- *Small-population paradigm and declining-population paradigm* ([lecture](LECTURE9.html), [lecture](LECTURE11.html), suggested reading: [Caughley 1988](caughley1.pdf))  
- *Population Viability Analysis*, in theory and practice ([lecture](LECTURE12.html), suggested reading [Beissinger and Westphal 1998](beissinger1.pdf), [optional lecture](LECTURE14.html))
- *Parameter estimation for PVA*, including basic capture-recapture methods ([lecture](LECTURE15.html), suggested reading: [Amstrup et al](amstrup1.pdf))

NOTE: we skipped over the [lecture on individual-based models](LECTURE10.html)- this topic will (of course) *not be included on the final exam*

*The exam will consist of a mixture of multiple-choice and short-answer questions (including a few definitions).*
