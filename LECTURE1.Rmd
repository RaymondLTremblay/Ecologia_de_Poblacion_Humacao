## Ecología de sistemas: una forma de pensar  
La ecología es desordenada. Cuando trabajamos en entornos naturales, estamos tratando con *sistemas intrínsecamente complejos*. _Todos los elementos de un sistema natural están conectados_, llenos de interacciones dinámicas. Interacciones entre organismos, entre organismos y sus entornos: estos vínculos son los que hacen que la ecología sea complicada, pero también infinitamente fascinante.

Podemos pensar en los humanos como un elemento más en estos complejos sistemas. Y la conservación y el manejo de la vida silvestre es la tarea de manipular estos vínculos para cumplir con los objetivos sociales de los sistemas naturales.

¡Esta no es una clase de ecología de sistemas!

PERO, el pensamiento sistémico proporciona un marco para comprender las poblaciones naturales y comprender cómo los vínculos (entornos abióticos y bióticos) podrían afectarlas y cómo gestionar las poblaciones naturales de manera eficaz.

## Propiedades emergentes
Esta es una de las ideas más poderosas en el pensamiento de sistemas completos: cuando se juntan muchas partes vinculadas e interactivas, los sistemas a menudo se comportan de maneras interesantes e inesperadas.

Tome un sistema clásico de depredador-presa ...

[Insightmaker Ejemplo de Lynx-Conejo](https://insightmaker.com/insight/68437/)  

Este es un ejemplo clásico en ecología de poblaciones, que revisaremos más adelante en este curso, pero por ahora sirve como un ejemplo de un sistema de interacción que exhibe una * propiedad emergente *.


Y aquí hay un ejemplo más abstracto que ilustra algunas propiedades emergentes realmente interesantes y complejas.

## *InsightMaker*: a modeling framework for systems thinking!

[InsightMaker](insightmaker.com) is a flexible web-based software for defining interacting systems and for modeling the behavior of inter-connected systems. 

Both of the above examples were constructed in InsightMaker.

We will make extensive use of InsightMaker, both during class and in lab- this will give you a chance to play around with complex and dynamic systems without needing a background in computer programming!

## Computer programming and systems thinking

Modern computers have reduced or eliminated many of the barriers to understanding how complex systems behave, and as a result **specialized software and computer programming** are a critical component to modern whole-systems analysis, including **ecosystems** analyses. Armed with basic facility with computer programming, ecologists and natural resource professionals can formalize their understanding of the natural systems in which they work, accounting for complex biological realities that may have been ignored if these tools were not available. **In this course, we will learn to harness the power of computer simulations for understanding and managing natural populations**.  

By the end of this course, students will have the ability to program their own *whole-systems models* in InsightMaker, and use specialized software for parameterizing these models (e.g., Program MARK, **R**)

A famous statistician ([George Box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_E._P._Box)) once said ["All models are wrong but some are useful"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong). What he meant was that no model can perfectly describe any real-world system (e.g., population dynamics). However, some models can help us to undersand how the real-world works and how to manage natural systems.

**This is especially true in ecology**: ecological systems are complex and messy, and it is clear that no mathematical model can perfectly describe and predict any ecological phenomena. But that does not mean that ecological models can't be *useful*!    
In this class (and beyond), _don't be afraid to model messy systems_. And above all, **don't be afraid to be wrong** - that attitude is the enemy of successful computer programming, and of learning in general! When we build our own algorithms, we can be entering uncharted territory. And this can be difficult and dangerous, but ultimately rewarding! Keep trying, and stay positive! And don't forget that all models are wrong!

Of course, this means not just reading and listening to lectures, it means *learning by doing*! Instructor-led lectures will be kept short, and we will spend significant class time (and pretty much all of lab time) on our computers, working through problems.

## In-class Exercise: InsightMaker

A [Stock] of stuff increases over time via what [Flows] in. Imagine our stock represents *Moose*! *Moose Births* would then be the input [Flow] to the population of *Moose* over time. 

A [Stock] of stuff decreases over time via what [Flows] out. For example, *Moose Deaths* could represent the [Flow] out of the population of *Moose*.

If the [Flow] in is larger than the [Flow] out then the [Stock] increases over time. 

If the [Flow] out is larger than the [Flow] in then the [Stock] decreases over time.

If the [Flow] in equals the [Flow] out then the amount in the [Stock] will not change over time.

The important takeaway is that a [Stock] represents a quantity of something. The [Stock] only changes over time via [Flows In] or [Flows Out]. A [Stock] doesn't change instantaneously. If there are no [Flows] then the [Stock] can not change.

Finally, a [Variable] is an object that stores an important piece of information for your model (e.g., birth rate could be a [Variable] that informs the total [Flow] of individuals into a [Stock] representing a wild population). [Variables] are generally connected to [Flows] with [Links] -- unlike [Flows], links do not represent any physical process. Instead, links simply represent *information*.   

1. Open up [InsightMaker](https://insightmaker.com/). If you have never used it before you need to sign up first with a username and password. *InsightMaker is free!*

2. Create a new "Insight" (the button to do this should be obvious!) and clear the demo model. 

3. **Create a population of Moose!** Right click in the center of the screen and select **Create Stock** from the pop-up. Notice that the name is *New Stock* and is selected. Type in a name for what this [Stock] represents (Moose!). Note the **Configuration Panel** on the right is now for a [Stock]. In the configuration panel, set the *Initial Value* to 50. That is, there will be 50 moose at the start of the simulation! 

- **OPTIONAL**: insert a picture of the animal you are modeling to your work canvas. The instructor will show you how in class!

4. **Specify the births process** Select the [Flows/Transitions] button in the upper left corner of your screen. Now notice that when you place your cursor over the [Stock] a small right-arrow displays. Click on the right-arrow and drag a couple inches to the left of the [Stock] and release. Type in a name for what this arrow represents (Births). NOTE: you have actually just created a [Flow] *out* of a [Stock]. To create a [Flow] *into* a [Stock], click on the **Reverse** button in the top menu (looks like two opposing arrows). Please do that now. Also in the **Configuration Panel** set **Flow Rate** equal to 1.

5. Now click **Run Simulation** and you have just finished your first population simulation model.

6. Can you figure out how to change the settings to run the model for 50 years? Try this and click **Run Simulation**.

7. Use the same methods as *step 4* to create a [Flow Out], representing deaths. Re-run the model. Is the population increasing or declining? Why? 

8. Change the **Configuration Panel** for the [Stock] and for the [Flow In] and [Flow Out] so that "Show Value Slider" is set to "Yes". You can change the model parameterization easily using these sliders. Try it a few times, re-running the simulation after each change. **Save your model** ("Save" button at the top menu) 

**Q**: Is this Moose model realistic? What are the first things you would like to change to make the model more realistic?

*Top Hat: take a few minutes to list the things you would like to change to make this model more realistic!*

9. Finally, take a few minutes to check out "Insights" made by others using the "explore insights" link at the top of the webpage. You can search the database of Insights. Pick one or two of these insights and run them. How does the system behave? Does this make sense to you? We can (and will) add to this database as part of this class! 

Just for fun, here is a cool video of the Lorenz Attractor, which we saw earlier!
