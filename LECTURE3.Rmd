> The power of population is indefinitely greater than the power in the earth to produce subsistence for man" - The Rev. Thomas Malthus

Or in a more verbose form...

> I think I may make fairly two postulata. First, that food is necessary to the existence of man. Secondly, that the passion between the sexes is necessary and will remain nearly in its present state ... Assuming then my postulata as granted, I say, that the power of population is infinitely greater than the power in the earth to produce subsistence for man. Population, when unchecked, increases in a geometrical ratio. Subsistence increases only in an arithmetical ratio. A slight acquaintance with numbers will show the immensity of the first power in comparison of the second. By the law of our nature which makes food necessary to the life of man, the effects of these two unequal powers must be kept equal. This implies a strong and constantly operating check on population from the difficulty of subsistence. This difficulty must fall somewhere and must necessarily be severely felt by a large portion of mankind...

And his argument can be summed up in this syllogism:

> That the increase of population is necessarily limited by the means of subsistence,
> That population does invariably increase when the means of subsistence increase, and,
> That the superior power of population is repressed by moral restraint, vice and misery

Is this an optimistic message or a pessimistic message?

Was Malthus right? For humans? For wildlife? Can you think of any examples for or against?

Interestingly, in 1838, four years after Malthus’ death, Charles Darwin, back from his voyage on HMS Beagle (1831–6), was searching for a mechanism to explain the transmutation of species. On reading Malthus’ essay on the principle of population, he at once grasped the possible implication of the checks that controlled population growth and wrote: 

> “...favourable variations would tend to be preserved, and unfavourable ones to be destroyed ... The result of this would be the formation of a new species. Here, then, I had at last got a theory by which to work.” - Charles Darwin 

Twenty one years later he published his famous book *On the origin of species by means of natural selection*. It too raised a storm of controversy and protest.



## Exercise: limits to growth

[example: if the population exceeds a limit, then a famine occurs and 95% of the population dies]

[what happens if the limit were allowed to increase arithmetically? ]

**Q** is this population *regulated*?
