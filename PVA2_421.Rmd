## PVA for Yellowstone grizzly bears!

By the time we meet on Thursday, March 28 be sure that this model is running on your laptop (in InsightMaker) because we will be exploring the model more fully in class together, and use this PVA to do some management-relevant **scenario testing**.

![](grizzly1.jpg)

Our goal is to better understand the future of the grizzly bear population in Yellowstone park, and the processes that may regulate this population!

Let's walk together through the basic steps in building and running a PVA model: 

#### Step 1: life history diagram

Based on the literature that we have read, we determine that there are four main stages in the grizzly bear life history: cub, yearling, subadult and adult! The adult stage is the only one that is reproductive!

Therefore, our conceptual life history diagram looks something like this!

![](IM16.jpg)

You can "clone" the base grizzly bear model [here](https://insightmaker.com/insight/162303/Yellowstone-Grizzlies-Unparameterized). This model has not yet been parameterized!

#### Step 2: parameterize!

Let's use this table to parameterize the population vital rates in our model!

This table actually has *two alternative parameterizations*, one summarized from data collected the period from 1983 through 2001, and the other representing data from the period from 2002-2011. 

NOTE: we are not paying any attention to males! Population models are often *female-only*, since females are the primary drivers of population dynamics.

![](grizzly_table1.jpg)

The table is from [this scientific report](YellowstoneScience-BearIssue.pdf) ([alternative link](https://www.nps.gov/yell/learn/upload/YellowstoneScience-BearIssue.pdf))

What about population size? For any simulation we always need to initialize abundance!

From [Schwartz et al 2006](schwarz_grizzly1.pdf) we know that:

1. Adult (reproductive) females represent approximately a quarter (25%) of the total population. 
2. Total abundance of adult females in the greater Yellowstone park area (solid squares plus the open triangles) was 5 to 10 in 1983 and 40 to 50 in 2001/2002 

![](grizzly_table2.jpg)

Let's use the lower bound for initial (1983) abundances (all female!) to initialize our model:

*Cubs:* 5   
*Yearlings:* 5   
*Subadult 1:* 2
*Subadult 2:* 2
*Subadult 3:* 2
*Adults:* 5   

Take a few minutes to parameterize the model, using the 1983 to 2001 estimates!

#### Step 3: Spatial structure

We are ignoring spatial structure for this PVA!

#### Step 4: Simulate!

Okay, let's run the model!

1. Try running the model with the parameterization we discussed above. What do you notice? Is the population growing?

*REALITY CHECK*:       

**Q**: Given that the population of adult females is known to have increased to around 30 individuals by the year 2002, is this model realistic??      

2. What if we configure the model to run for 100 years? What happens now?

**Q**: *NOW* do you think this is biologically realistic? Why or why not?

3. Let's change the parameterization to reflect the vital rates observed for the period 2002 to 2011 in the table:


![](grizzly_table1.jpg)

In 2002 the population was more like 40 females- so let's use the following parameterization!

*Cubs:* 40   
*Yearlings:* 40   
*Subadult 1:*  15
*Subadult 2:*  15
*Subadult 3:*  10
*Adults:* 40

**Q**: What do you notice about this model? Is it still growing? What about the overall *rate of growth* of the population?
40
**Q**: Which vital rates changed the most from 1983 to 2002? 

**Q**: Can you think of any reason for this change?

##### Density-dependence

4. Let's implement a new process into our model- **density-dependence**!

We know that when the total (female) population size was around 20, yearling survival was around 82%

We also know that when the total (female) population size was around 160, yearling survival dropped to around 54%

What is the **linear relationship** between population size and yearling survival? When abundance increased by 140, yearling survival rate decreased from 82% to 54% -- a 28% drop! 

**SLOPE**: For each additional individual in the adult population, yearling survival decreased by 0.2 % ($=\frac{0.28}{140}$).

**INTERCEPT**: This can be interpreted as the expected yearling survival when there are no adults in the population. When there were 5 adults, yearling survival was 81.7%. If there were 0 individuals in the adult population, yearling survival would be $81.7 + 0.2\cdot 5$, which is 82.7%. 

To convert back to a fraction, we divide this linear model by 100!

So the linear formula for computing yearling survival as a function of adult female abundance should be:

$Surv_{yearling} = \frac{\left (  82.7 - 0.2*N_{female} \right )}{100}$

Let's implement this *density-dependent process* in Insightmaker!

- First, load [this InsightMaker model](https://insightmaker.com/insight/162306/Yellowstone-Grizzlies-densdep-noequation). Clone it so you can make edits!

- Open the *equation editor* for yearling survival, and input the equation above! Let's do it together!  

Run the model! What do you notice?

Try running the model for 200 years. 

**Q**: Why is this type of model called **density-dependent**?


### Grizzly bear in-class exercises

**Answer the following questions**:

To start off, you can clone a full, density-dependent version of the grizzly model [here](https://insightmaker.com/insight/162305/Yellowstone-Grizzlies-densdep)


1. Set the initial abundances back to the values estimated from 1983 to 2001. Run the model for 200 years. What is the approximate **carrying capacity** of this population? NOTE: this is an **emergent property** of our new model! We didn't specify carrying capacity, but nonetheless there seems to be a carrying capacity for this population. 

2. "Comment out" the density dependence equation in the equation editor for yearling survival (place a pound sign before the equation), and type in the value of yearling survival estimated for the 2002-2011 time period (0.539). This enables you to run the grizzly bear PVA with and without the density-dependence process (using the pound signs to alternately comment out the density-dependence equation or the value '0.539'; see below). 

**Q** In each case (with and without density-dependence), what is the approximate 95% confidence interval for the total population abundance after 100 years? (use the 'sensitivity testing' tool) 

**Q** Under which scenario (with and without density-dependence) is the *conservation outlook* best for grizzly bears in Yellowstone park?

3. Given that local managers have decided that a viable grizzly bear population should have no more than a 5% risk of falling below 20 individuals at any time over the next 100 years, can you identify an approximate **minimum viable population size (MVP)** for this population?

[Bonus question!]. For the *density-independent* model, what is the extinction risk if you changed yearling survival to its **lower confidence limit** in the above table (from 2002-2011)? Does the *parameter uncertainty* in the above table make a difference for the conservation outlook for this population??  

#### Helpful hints

##### "commenting out" the density-dependence equation

You can turn the density dependence process on and off by using the pound symbol to "comment out" the equation. So ... if you input the following into the equation editor for yearling survival, you can easily go back and forth between the density-dependent and the density-independent formulations of the model:

For example, this one is density-independent:

```
0.539
#0.827-0.002*[Total abundance]
```

...and this one is density-dependent:

```
#0.539
0.827-0.002*[Total abundance]
```

##### using the sensitivity testing tool

Use the "sensitivity testing" option in the "Tools" menu to run multiple simulations. You can visually assess the risk of falling below a certain abundance threshold by examining whether a particular quantile (e.g., 95%) of your simulation results (the output from the sensitivity testing tool) falls below a particular threshold (e.g., 20 individuals) over a certain number of years. 

You can compute the risk of extinction or decline more quantitatively as the fraction of replicates that failed to meet the specified criterion. That is, you can divide the total number of simulations falling below the threshold by the total numer of replicates.
